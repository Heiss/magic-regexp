# magic-regexp

This library wants to simplify your regex-experience without the need to learn regex everytime you need to work with it. So it implements an easy to read syntactic. Also it can be used to work with the excellent [regex](https://crates.io/crates/regex) crate. So you not have to implement random regex-strings anymore, instead you write native and readable `rust`-code.

## Inspiration

This library is heavily inspired by [magic-regexp](https://github.com/danielroe/magic-regexp).
